This post is **published**, so it shows up on the blog index and at `/blog/getting-started`.

## How it works

1. **Content** — Posts are `.mdx` files in `content/blog/`. Slug comes from the filename.
2. **Status** — Set `status: published` or `status: draft` in frontmatter. Drafts are not listed or viewable.
3. **Pagination** — When there are more than 10 published posts, the index is paginated (10 per page).

## Frontmatter

Required:

- `title` — Post title
- `status` — `"draft"` or `"published"`

Optional:

- `excerpt` — Shown in the list and used for meta description
- `date` — Publication date (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD`)
