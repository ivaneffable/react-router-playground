Welcome to the first post. This is **MDX** in action: you get Markdown plus JSX.

Here’s a short code sample:

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
greet("Blog");
```

And a list:

- MDX files live in `content/blog/`
- Frontmatter defines `title`, `status`, `excerpt`, `date`
- Only **published** posts appear in the index and at `/blog/:slug`

That’s it for this sample.
